    title: "Exploring gRPC and Flutter for Modern App Development",
    short_description:
      "Recent developments have made the demand for more robust and distributed tools that can function across multiple teams increasingly evident. gRPC tools are particularly potent in these scenarios. They can generate server-side code for Golang or Dart and support various server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and . NET. In addition, they can generate code for client-side languages including Dart, Swift, Objective-C, Java, and Kotlin.",

    title: "Implementing Unit tests for Riverpod",
    short_description:
      "Unit testing in Flutter is a great way to ensure the quality of your code. It helps to identify bugs early on and reduce the risk of them making it to production. Unit tests can be written quickly and easily, and they provide a comprehensive overview of the code's functionality. By running unit tests regularly, you can be sure that your code is working as expected and that any changes you make don't cause unexpected issues.",
