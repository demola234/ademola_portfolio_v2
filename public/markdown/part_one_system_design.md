## **Introduction**

> ðŸ’¡ I started learning Go three years ago as a second programming language, seeking a scalable, efficient, and versatile technology with great potential. Since then, Iâ€™ve been captivated by its power and simplicity. Realio reflects my passion for creating feature-rich applications that not only simulate real-world use cases but also serve as learning experiences for myself and others.

### What is Realio?

Realio is an innovative property management and investment platform designed to transform the real estate industry. Inspired by leading solutions like Zillow, it enables seamless property exploration, personalized recommendations, and efficient appointment scheduling. Built with a robust microservices architecture, Realio ensures unparalleled scalability, maintainability, and performance, making it the go-to platform for both users and agents.

### Why Golang for Realio?

Golang, or Go, is an open-source programming language developed and supported by Google. It is designed for simplicity, scalability, and high performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern, distributed systems like Realio.

- **Adoption by Big Tech:** Companies such as Google, Netflix, Dropbox, Uber, Meta, and Twitch leverage Go for cloud and network services, web applications, and command-line tools.
- **Ease of Use:** Goâ€™s straightforward syntax and rich standard library make it beginner-friendly while still offering advanced capabilities.
- **Performance:** Its compiled nature ensures fast execution, while concurrency primitives like goroutines and channels simplify building scalable, high-performance applications.

### Why Microservices?

Microservices architecture divides a complex application into smaller, autonomous services, each focusing on specific functionalities. This approach offers:

1. **Scalability:** Services can scale independently to handle varying loads.
2. **Resilience:** Failures in one service do not impact others, ensuring system reliability.
3. **Flexibility:** Teams can choose the most suitable technologies for individual services.
4. **Faster Development:** Independent services allow parallel development, accelerating delivery cycles.

## **System Overview**

### Objective

To deliver a scalable, user-friendly property management solution that caters to:

1. **Property Listings:** Streamlined CRUD operations with advanced filtering options.
2. **User Interactions:** AI-powered recommendations, real-time messaging, and instant notifications.
3. **High Traffic Management:** Support millions of daily users with optimal performance.

### Functional Requirements

### **For Customers:**

- Advanced property search and filtering.
- Seamless booking and management of property viewings.
- Personalized notifications for updates and reminders.

### **For Agents:**

- Easy property listing management.
- Comprehensive tracking of customer appointments.
- Real-time communication with potential buyers or renters.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Maintain low latency under high traffic conditions.
- **Reliability:** Ensure minimal downtime with robust failover mechanisms.
- **Security:** Implement best practices to safeguard user data.
- **Usability:** Offer an intuitive and accessible interface across devices.

## **Architectural Principles**

### Clean Architecture

Realio adopts clean architecture principles to enhance modularity, testability, and scalability. Key principles include:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Isolate business logic from external dependencies.
2. **Layered Design:** Distinct layers for presentation, application, domain, and data.
3. **Testability:** Simplified testing through well-defined interfaces.

### Microservices Communication

1. **gRPC:** For high-performance, binary-based inter-service communication.
2. **Kafka:** Enables event-driven architecture with asynchronous messaging for real-time updates.

## **Core Technologies**

### Backend Development

- **Go:** High-performance services for user management and property operations.
- **Python:** Advanced data processing and recommendation services leveraging libraries like Scikit-learn.

### Communication and Event-Driven Architecture

- **gRPC:** Efficient protocol for inter-service requests.
- **Kafka:** Handles asynchronous data streaming for events like bookings and notifications.

### Databases and Caching

- **PostgreSQL:** Reliable, relational database for structured data.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading.
- **Redis:** In-memory caching to enhance response times.
- **Elasticsearch:** Optimized search engine for complex property filtering.

### Infrastructure and DevOps

- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployments.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestration of containerized services for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Real-time monitoring and visualization.
- **Open-Telemetry:** Directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

## **Detailed Service Breakdown**

### 1. User Service

Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles. Features include:

- **JWT Authentication:** Ensures secure user sessions.
- **Role Management:** Differentiates between customers and agents.
- **Profile Updates:** Handles user preferences and settings.

### 2. Property Service

Enables CRUD operations for property listings, with geospatial data integration for location-based searches.

### 3. Search Service

Provides advanced filtering options using Elasticsearch for:

- Price range, property type, and location filters.
- Keyword-based search.

### 4. Recommendation Service

Uses machine learning to:

- Analyze user interactions for personalized suggestions.
- Train real-time models using Kafka-streamed data.

### 5. Booking and Scheduling Service

Handles:

- Property viewing appointments.
- Conflict-free scheduling algorithms.

### 6. Messaging and Notification Services

**Messaging Service:**

- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets enable instant messaging between customers and agents.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores chat histories and message metadata.

**Notification Service:**

- **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Sends alerts via email, SMS, and push notifications.
- **Delivery Tracking:** Tracks notification statuses.
- **Tools:** Utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications and email.

## **System Design**

### High-Level Design

1. **API Gateway:** Single entry point for routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
2. **Service Communication:** Combines gRPC for synchronous calls and Kafka for event-driven processes.
3. **Database Layer:** Distributed PostgreSQL and Redis for fast, reliable data storage and retrieval.
4. **Event Streaming:** Kafka streams enable real-time updates and notifications.

### Low-Level Design

1. **Caching Strategy:** Redis caches frequently accessed data.
2. **Service Discovery:** API Gateway dynamically routes requests to available service instances.
3. **Data Flow:** Example: A booking triggers events for notifications and updates the recommendation engine.

## **Key Features**

### Personalized Recommendations

- Machine learning models trained on Scikit-learn.
- Real-time updates based on user interactions.
